Over the course of two days, a total of 204 players were auctioned for over 550 crore rupees during the IPL mega auction of 2022. Analyzing this extensive list of players selected by the 10 participating teams, along with an additional 33 players either retained or chosen in the draft by new teams, proves to be a daunting task. This challenge prompted me to develop a Power BI dashboard aimed at facilitating the analysis of all sold players in the IPL auction of 2022.

The dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of the auction proceedings through various visual representations. One such visual showcases the distribution of players and their average costs based on skills and nationality within specific price brackets. A slicer tool allows users to filter the desired price range for analysis. Additionally, a color-coded visual displays the players along with their respective auction prices, categorized by the franchises they belong to. Notably, within the price range of 10 to 15.25 crore rupees, 11 players were selected, with Ishan Kishan from Mumbai Indians emerging as the highest-paid player, fetching a staggering sum of 15.25 crore rupees. Every team participated in bids of at least 10 crore rupees for a player, with the Royal Challengers Bangalore securing two such players.

Another segment of the dashboard focuses on individual franchises. Users can utilize a slicer tool to select a specific franchise for detailed analysis. Two additional slicers enable further filtering of players based on their skills and nationality. The dashboard includes three informative cards displaying the highest-paid player in the auction, the total number of players, and the average cost of players based on the applied filters. A list on the right side presents comprehensive player information based on the selected filters. Furthermore, a bar graph at the bottom depicts player names on the x-axis and their salaries on the y-axis, with a legend color-coding the graph based on player skills. This graph encompasses information about both auctioned and retained players. For instance, Royal Challengers Bangalore acquired 22 players with an average cost close to 4.02 crore rupees per player, with Harshal Patel emerging as their highest-paid acquisition at 10.75 crore rupees.
